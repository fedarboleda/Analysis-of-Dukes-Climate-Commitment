# Analysis of Duke's Climate Commitment

In September 2022, Duke administration unveiled the "Duke Climate Commitment," a series of goals intended on "activating every facet of our institution 
to create a model for educating and deploying a generation of climate- and sustainability-fluent change makers" — including achieving carbon neutrality by 
2024. Over the past two decades, Duke has pursued multiple climate initiatives to reduce emissions, including the 2009 Climate Action Plan. This project 
will compile and visualize data related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at Duke, then combine these visualizations to tell the story of Duke's GHG 
emissions together on a data dashboard using the flexdashboard package.Our project aims to construct a data dashboard highlighting the goals and progress
made by the Duke Climate Commitment in achieving a sustainable, carbon-neutral campus. 

Special thanks to Jason Elliot of Sustainable Duke for providing the stat-stainable team with incredibly valuable Duke climate data during our research process.
